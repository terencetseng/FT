While the Chinese are known for being excellent savers, they are brand lovers, not unlike the famous Japanese luxury shoppers.  While the number of Chinese shoppers who can afford luxury goods is still quite small as a percentage of the 1.3 billion Chinese populous, it is growing rapidly.  Luxury goods companies are rapidly expanding across Chinese cities, enjoying rapid growth, which we expect to continue as the country continues to develop. In fact,we are participating in this consumer growth across several aspects of retail, including global grocery and general merchandise and do-it-yourself home stores which we have long followed and which are now expanding in China.",

                            "<p>All investments involve risks. Special risks are associated with foreign investing, including currency fluctuations, economic instability and political developments. Investments in developing markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors, in addition to those associated with these markets&rsquo; smaller size and lesser liquidity. These and other risk considerations are discussed in a fund&rsquo;s prospectus.</p>",
